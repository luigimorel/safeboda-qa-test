## Getting Started

Have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- A code editor
- Java SDK
- Java Extension Pack if you're using VS Code
- Selenium and a Chrome Web Driver

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Running the script

To keep things simpler, I decided to work with a single file. This is due to presence of the documentation that's being followed.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
